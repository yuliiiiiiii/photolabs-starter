# react-photolabs
The PhotoLabs project for the Web Development React course programming.

# Photolabs
PhotoLabs is a React-based single-page application (SPA) that allows users to view photos in different contexts:
1. A user can view photos from the homepage loaded from the API.
2. The user can navigate to different photo categories, also called topics.
3. The user can click on a photo to view a larger version of the photo and relevant / similar photos.
4. The user can like a photo from anywhere within the application where the photo is displayed.
5.The user can view a heart icon with a notification in the navigation if there are liked photos.
6. The navigation will consist of different topics and heart icon.
7. The client-side application will make API requests to load and persist data (i.e. relevant data is not lost after a session restarts, so after a browser refresh).
